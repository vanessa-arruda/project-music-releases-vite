# Music Releases

Project made by Vanessa Arruda as part of Technigo's JavaScript & React 11 weeks Course.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Create a responsive page using React, JS, multiple Components and Responsive design for multiple screen sizes.

### View it live

This project is deployed on Netlify: https://celebrated-puppy-3c3a5d.netlify.app/
And code available in my repository: https://github.com/vanessa-arruda/project-music-releases-vite/
